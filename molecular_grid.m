% grid = molecular_grid(atoms,xyz_a0,nRadialPoints,nAngularPoints)
%
% Generates a full grid for the evaluation of the exchange-correlation
% integrals in DFT. the function returns the Cartesian coordinates of all
% grid points and their respective weights.
%
% Input:
%    atoms            element numbers, e.g. [6 8] for carbon monoxide
%    xyz_a0           Kx3 array of cartesian coordinates, in bohr radii
%    nRadialPoints    number of radial grid points (typically 50-75)
%    nAngularsPoints  number of angular grid points (possible values:
%                        50, 110, 194, 302, 434, 590, 770)
% Output:
%    grid: structure containing all information about the molecular grid
%      .xyz          Cartesian coordinates for grid points, one per row,
%                      in units of Bohr radii
%      .weights      weights (product of radial and angular weights and r^2)
